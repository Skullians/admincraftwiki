Welcome to the Admincraft wiki. This is a collection of useful guides and documentation for the community to use for developing their Minecraft server.\
This wiki is primarily maintained and improved by the [Admincraft community](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/), however we are always open for [contributions](contribution.mdx).

This wiki intends to cover as many key topics and points concerning developing and running a Minecraft server, of which you can explore and read by expanding the categories located on the left.
